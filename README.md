# reviewer-bias-game

This model simulates how unfair assessments of article submissions influences the acceptance of article submissions. This model makes the following baseline assumption:

**If no reviewer is biased, n(good papers) = n(accepted papers)**

Alternatively:
**If all reviewers are biased, n(bad papers) = n(accepted papers)**

Similarly:
**If no reviewer is biased, n(papers) = n(fair decisions)**
